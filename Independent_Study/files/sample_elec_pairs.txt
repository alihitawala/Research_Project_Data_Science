The Lexmark 18C0031 has a page yield of 135. Buy 18C0031 for your Lexmark printer.&nbsp;&nbsp;This photo ink cartridge contains 1/3 black, 1/3 light cyan and a 1/3 light magenta. You replace your black cartridge with this photo color inkjet cartridge. It goes in the black slot, not the color slot. When you have the photo and regular color cartridge in your printer it produces better looking photos. Instead of only having four colors to print with (black, cyan, magenta, and yellow) it now has six colors. Photo inkjet cartridges are great for people who print lots of photos or color documents but not recommended for people who print mainly text. This is because the photo cartridge has about a third as much black ink in it compared with a black cartridge. Once this ink is out the cartridge has to be replaced. Even if the light cyan and light magenta sections are full of ink you will need a new cartridge. Printers these days print photos well with four colors but excellent with six colors.

The Sangean waterproof H201 radio allows you can enjoy your morning news, your favorite radio show, stock and financial news, or your local ball games. Unlike other shower radios, most of which are just water resistant; the Sangean H201 is made with JIS7 standard, which is waterproof. This radio is submersible and meets waterproofing standards that are equal to marine radios. It is so versatile that you can enjoy your radio programs while showering, take it on a fishing trip, take it to the beach, and never be afraid of water or sand damaging your radio. If you get caught in the rain, it doesnt matter. If you drop it off your boat while fishing, this radio will float.  This radio has a loud audio that sounds great, excellent reception quality, extremely portable, and runs on two D cell batteries that will last a long time without having to change them. The push-button controls and waterproof speaker are impervious to any wet environments. Built with a sturdy, white cabinet, this radio has 5 digital presets for each band (AM/FM). You can easily lock into your favorite stations without relying on inaccurate dial tuning.  There are two mounting options: By its curved, tracked, unique handle that folds into the unit, you can hang it from your shower head, shower curtain rod, or towel bar. Or, you can opt for wall-mounted brackets which are included.  Other great features include set time (1 to 120 minutes), LED flashlight, battery level indicator, large LCD read out clock, emergency buzzer, plus other features. Who could ask for much more.
